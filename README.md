## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I practiced

I practiced correct flexbox theory and practice.

```html
  <main>
    <section class="card">
     ...
    </section>
  </main>
```
```css
main {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    ...
}

.card {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    ...
}
```

### Continued development

I'll continue working on the proper functioning of the footer.

### Useful resources

- [A guide to Flexbox | css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [PerfectPixel | Extension para el navegador](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=es-419) - This helped me order the correct dimensions. I really liked this extension and will use it in the future.
